UI Tweaks for Destiny.gg

- Updated icons for chat
- Hover over the top of the screen while in Cinema Mode to show the menu bar
- Hover over the bottom of the screen while in Cinema Mode to show stream controls
- Direct link to rustlesearch.dev logs in the right click menu in chat
- Increase link hitbox size

All features can be toggled and adjusted in the DGG settings menu (same one as for profile settings).
Chat-related settings can be edited live from the settings icon in chat.

I recommend installing this as an unpacked extension, as it can take a long time for a new version to go through review, so the webstore may not be up-to-date.

If you have any feature suggestions, feel free to add a github issue or write a review on the chrome store.
