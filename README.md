UI Tweaks for Destiny.gg

- Updated icons for chat
- Hover over the top of the screen while in Cinema Mode to show the menu bar
- Hover over the bottom of the screen while in Cinema Mode to show stream controls
- Direct link to rustlesearch.dev logs in the right click menu in chat
- Increase link hitbox size

All features can be toggled and adjusted in the DGG settings menu (same one as for profile settings).
Chat-related settings can be edited live from the settings icon in chat.

The hope is that extension eventually becomes redundant, as I've also submitted these features to the main DGG chat github, so they will hopefully be eventually included for everyone.
If you have any feature suggestions, feel free to add a github issue or write a review on the chrome store.
